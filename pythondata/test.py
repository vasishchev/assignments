# This example starts with a list, `mylist` and prints out the first element of the list. Note that lists in python are 0-indexed. The first element of the list is `1`.
mylist = [1, 2, 3]
print(mylist[0])

# Then, we append `4` to the end of the list and print the whole thing out. We can see the list now has 4 elements.
mylist.append(4)
print(mylist)

# Last, we print out the element with index 2 (i.e. the 3rd element of the list which is 3).
print(mylist[2])
